# Decentralized Digital Identity Verification System

## Overview

The Decentralized Digital Identity Verification System is a blockchain-based solution that empowers individuals to own, control, and selectively share their digital identity credentials. Built on principles of self-sovereign identity, this system enables secure, private, and portable digital identity management without reliance on centralized authorities.

## Core Components

### Identity Provider Verification Contract
Establishes trust in the ecosystem by validating and registering legitimate credential issuers, maintaining a registry of authorized identity providers, and implementing governance mechanisms for provider reputation management.

### Personal Data Vault Contract
Provides encrypted storage for individual identity attributes, implements granular access controls, and ensures users maintain exclusive ownership of their personal data while enabling selective disclosure.

### Credential Issuance Contract
Manages the creation and registration of verifiable credentials, implements cryptographic proof mechanisms, and maintains a tamper-evident record of issued credentials without exposing private data on-chain.

### Consent Management Contract
Gives users complete control over data sharing permissions, implements time-based and purpose-limited consent mechanisms, and maintains comprehensive audit trails of all data access authorizations.

### Verification Contract
Enables third parties to verify identity claims without accessing underlying data, implements zero-knowledge proof verification, and provides verification status responses without revealing personal information.
